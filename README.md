## Installing Juypter and ijavascript

Github has a notebook file previewer, but it will not display images properly.  To fully view the notebook files you will need to install Jupyter notebooks and the ijavascript kernel as follows:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyter
npm install -g ijavascript
ijsinstall
```

* assumes you already have Python and Node.js installed.

Clone this repository and run the following in the project directory
to start Jupyter and open the notebook files:

```
jupyter notebook
```
